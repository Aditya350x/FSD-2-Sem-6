## ⚙️ Procedure  
1. Created a new React project using Vite for fast development.  
2. Installed react-router-dom to enable client-side routing.  
3. Created individual page components: Home, About, and Contact.  
4. Configured routing in App.jsx using BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route.  
5. Defined route paths for each page component.  
6. Implemented navigation links for seamless page transitions.  
7. Applied CSS styling for a clean and consistent layout.  
8. Tested all routes to ensure proper navigation without page reloads.  
9. Pushed the completed project to GitHub with proper version control.
