## 🧪 Experiment Title  
Optimize Frontend Performance in React using Lazy Loading and Code Splitting

---

## 🎯 Aim of the Experiment  
To optimize the frontend performance of a React application by implementing lazy loading and route-based code splitting using React.lazy() and Suspense, thereby reducing the initial load time of the application.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Required  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Node.js and npm  
- React.js  
- React Router DOM  
- Vite  
- HTML5 & CSS3  
- Git and GitHub

## ⚙️ Procedure  
1. Created a new React project using Vite for faster development and optimized builds.  
2. Installed and configured React Router DOM for navigation between pages.  
3. Created separate components for Home, Contact, and About pages.  
4. Implemented lazy loading for components using React.lazy().  
5. Used Suspense to display a fallback UI while lazy-loaded components are loading.  
6. Applied route-based code splitting so components load only when their routes are accessed.  
7. Introduced a visible loading delay to clearly demonstrate lazy loading behavior.  
8. Verified that the initial bundle size was reduced compared to eager loading.  
9. Tested navigation between routes to ensure correct rendering of lazy-loaded components.  
10. Uploaded the completed project to GitHub with proper version control.

---

## ✅ Result  
The experiment was successfully completed. Lazy loading and route-based code splitting were implemented using React.lazy() and Suspense. The application demonstrated improved initial load performance, with components loading only when required.

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes  
After completing this experiment, the student is able to:  
- Understand the importance of frontend performance optimization  
- Implement lazy loading in React applications  
- Use React.lazy() and Suspense effectively  
- Apply route-based code splitting  
- Reduce initial bundle size in React applications  
- Improve user experience through faster initial loading  

---

## 📌 Conclusion  
This experiment demonstrates how frontend performance can be optimized using lazy loading in React. By loading components only when required, the initial load time is reduced, resulting in better performance and improved user experience. Lazy loading is an effective technique for building efficient and scalable React applications.
