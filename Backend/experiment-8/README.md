## ⚙️ Backend Implementation  

The backend server was created using Flask. Student data is stored in an in-memory Python list (array). CRUD operations were implemented using RESTful API principles.

---

## 🧪 Testing

All CRUD operations were tested using Postman.  

Screenshots of successful API requests and responses are included in the submission zip file.

---

## 🚀 Deployment on Render

The project was deployed on the Render cloud platform by connecting the GitHub repository and configuring the build and start commands.

---

## ✅ Result

The RESTful API server was successfully developed using Flask. All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) were implemented and tested using Postman. The application was deployed successfully on Render and made accessible via a public URL.
