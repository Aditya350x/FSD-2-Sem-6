## ⚙️ Procedure
1. Installed Node.js and npm on the system to support React development.  
2. Created a new React project using Vite for faster build and development.  
3. Opened the project in VS Code for writing and managing the source code.  
4. Organised the project structure by creating separate folders for components.  
5. Developed functional React components using JSX syntax.  
6. Integrated all components into the main App.jsx file.  
7. Applied basic CSS styling to improve the user interface.  
8. Executed the application locally using npm commands.  
9. Tested the application output in the web browser.  
10. Used Git and GitHub to commit and push the experiment for submission.

## ✅ Result
The React application was successfully created and executed using Vite.  
The application ran smoothly in the browser and demonstrated proper use of reusable components, clean project structure, and successful version control using GitHub.
