## **⚙️ Procedure**
1. **Installed Node.js and npm** on the system to support React development.
2. **Created a new React project** using Vite for faster build and development.
3. **Opened the project in VS Code** for writing and managing the source code.
4. **Organised the project structure** by creating separate folders for components.
5. **Developed functional React components** using JSX syntax.
6. **Integrated components** into the main `App.jsx` file.
7. **Applied basic CSS styling** to improve the user interface.
8. **Executed the application locally** using the following commands:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev

## **✅ Result**
The React application was successfully created and executed using **Vite**.  
The experiment achieved the following outcomes:

- Successful creation of a React project using Vite  
- Proper implementation of reusable React components  
- Clean and well-organized project structure  
- Smooth execution of the application in the web browser  
- Successful version control and submission using GitHub
