## ⚙️ Procedure  
1. Created a new React project using Vite for faster development and optimized performance.  
2. Installed React Hook Form and Yup libraries for form state management and validation.  
3. Designed a registration form with fields such as username, email, password, and terms acceptance.  
4. Implemented form handling using the `useForm` hook from React Hook Form.  
5. Defined a Yup validation schema to validate user inputs like email format and password length.  
6. Integrated Yup schema with React Hook Form using `yupResolver`.  
7. Displayed validation error messages dynamically below each input field.  
8. Handled successful form submission by validating data and displaying confirmation messages.  
9. Styled the form using CSS for better layout and readability.  
10. Tested the form with valid and invalid inputs and stored the project using GitHub version control.

---

## ✅ Result  
The experiment was successfully completed. The React application correctly handled form inputs and validations using React Hook Form and Yup. Error messages were displayed appropriately, and valid form submissions were processed successfully.

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes  
After completing this experiment, the student is able to:  
- Understand the importance of form handling in web applications  
- Implement validated forms in React  
- Use React Hook Form for efficient form state management  
- Apply Yup for schema-based input validation  
- Display meaningful error messages to users  
- Improve overall user experience through validation  

---

## 📌 Conclusion  
This experiment demonstrates the implementation of form handling and validation in React applications. React Hook Form simplifies form state management, while Yup provides a structured and scalable approach to validation, resulting in clean, maintainable, and user-friendly forms.
