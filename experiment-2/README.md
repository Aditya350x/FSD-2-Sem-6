## 🧪 Experiment Title
Development of a Multi-Page React Application using React Router DOM (Single Page Application)

---

## 🎯 Aim of the Experiment
To design and develop a Single Page Application (SPA) using React and Vite, implementing client-side routing with `react-router-dom` to enable seamless navigation between multiple components without page reloads.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Required
- VS Code
- Node.js and npm
- React.js
- Vite
- React Router DOM
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Git and GitHub

## ⚙️ Procedure
1. Initialized a new React project using Vite and installed the `react-router-dom` library.
2. Configured the main entry point in `main.jsx` to support routing.
3. Created a dedicated `Components` folder to house modular UI elements and page views.
4. Developed core page components including `Home.jsx`, `About.jsx`, and `Contact.jsx`.
5. Created reusable UI components such as `Button`, `TextField`, `Checkbox`, and `Select`.
6. Implemented a `Spa.jsx` component to manage navigation links and routing logic.
7. Defined application routes using `<Routes>` and `<Route>` components in `App.jsx`.
8. Applied global and component-specific styles using `index.css` and `App.css`.
9. Verified the Single Page Application behavior by navigating between views without browser refreshes.
10. Committed the final project structure to GitHub for version control.

## ✅ Result
The Multi-Page React application was successfully developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The navigation system functions correctly using React Router, allowing users to switch between different views smoothly while maintaining a clean, component-based architecture.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
After completing this experiment, the student is able to:
- Implement client-side routing using React Router DOM
- Understand the difference between traditional multi-page sites and SPAs
- Create complex component hierarchies and reusable UI elements
- Manage navigation state and URL parameters in a React environment
- Structure a larger-scale React project with multiple assets and components
- Integrate third-party libraries into a Vite-based development workflow
- Use Git to manage multi-experiment repository structures

---

## 📌 Conclusion
This experiment provided practical knowledge on building SPAs, a core requirement for modern web development. It demonstrated how to effectively manage multiple views and reusable components within a single React application, further enhancing proficiency in full-stack frontend technologies
