## 🧪 Experiment Title
Building Reusable UI Components and Enhancing Page Architecture in React

---

## 🎯 Aim of the Experiment
To design and develop five reusable UI design components (Button, TextField, Select, Rating, and Checkbox) and integrate them into existing page components (Home, About, and Contact) to create a modular and interactive user interface.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Required
- VS Code
- Node.js and npm
- React.js
- Vite
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Git and GitHub

## ⚙️ Procedure
1. Created five separate functional components for UI elements: **Button, TextField, Select, Rating, and Checkbox**.
2. Designed each UI component to be reusable by utilizing props for custom labeling and data handling.
3. Copied the core page components (**Home, About, and Contact**) from Experiment 1 into the new project structure.
4. Imported and integrated all five new UI components into the **Home** page to build a functional dashboard view.
5. Added relevant UI components to the **About** and **Contact** pages to enhance user interactivity and form handling.
6. Managed the layout and spacing of the integrated components using CSS Grid and Flexbox in `App.css`.
7. Verified that each component renders correctly and maintains its individual state across different pages.
8. Synchronized the final project with the GitHub repository, ensuring all new sub-folders are properly tracked.

## ✅ Result
The experiment was successfully completed by creating five modular UI components. By integrating these into the pages migrated from Experiment 1, a more robust and interactive component-based architecture was achieved.

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
After completing this experiment, the student is able to:
- Build highly reusable atom-level UI components in React.
- Efficiently migrate and refactor code from previous projects.
- Pass data and styles between parent (Page) and child (UI) components via props.
- Implement complex form elements like Select, Rating, and Checkboxes within a React environment.
- Maintain a clean and scalable project structure for growing applications.

## 📌 Conclusion
This experiment demonstrated the power of the "Atomic Design" approach in React. By building small, reusable components first and then assembling them into pages, the development process becomes faster and the codebase remains much easier to maintain.
